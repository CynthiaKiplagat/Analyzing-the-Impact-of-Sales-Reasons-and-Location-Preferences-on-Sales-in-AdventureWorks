# Analyzing the Impact of Discounts Sales Reasons and Location Preferences on Sales in AdventureWorks
## Introduction 
In the business environment, understanding the factors that influence sales performance is essential for strategic decision-making. Businesses consistently strive to enhance sales through various methods such as promotions, discounts, and catering to customer preferences. This project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of three key aspects that can significantly affect sales outcomes: discounts, sales reasons, and location preferences.
## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
* Assess the impact of discounts on the effective sales price.
* Determine the influence of sales reasons on the quantity of products purchased.
* Analyze how location affects the preference for certain products.
## Data Source
We will utilise the AdventureWorks Database.
## Methodology 
The methodology involves;
1. Data Extraction: Using SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database.
2. Data Aggregation: Summarizing data to compute total sales, discounts, quantities, and other metrics.
3. Data Analysis: Using Python libraries (such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn) to perform detailed analysis and create visualizations.
4. Reporting: Compiling results into comprehensive reports with visualizations to highlight key findings.

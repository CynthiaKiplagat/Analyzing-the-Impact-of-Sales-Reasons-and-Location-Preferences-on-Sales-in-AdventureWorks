## Introduction 
In the business environment, understanding the factors that influence sales performance is essential for strategic decision-making. Businesses consistently strive to enhance sales through various methods such as promotions, discounts, and catering to customer preferences. This project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of two key aspects that can significantly affect sales outcomes: sales reasons, and location preferences.
## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
* Determine the influence of sales reasons on the quantity of products purchased.

## Methodology 
The methodology involves;
1. Data Extraction: Using SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database.
2. Data cleaning and processing:Prepare the extracted data for analysis
3. Data Aggregation: Summarizing data to compute total sales, quantities, and other metrics.
4. Data Analysis: Using Python libraries (such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn) to perform detailed analysis and create visualizations.
5. Reporting: Compiling results into comprehensive reports with visualizations to highlight key findings.
